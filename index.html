                    <p> 
                        For the time I have known Mark Mwaura Wanjema, 
                           I have seen the effort he puts into his work  to make sure he acquires the necessary <br>
                           skills in his career. He's passionate and dedicated in coding and <br> web development. 
                           I have seen the hard work he puts in it for him to <br> emerge among the best of the best. 
                           He sacrifices his time to learn and put in practice what he has learnt.
                            He's not just after money as most of the people would be after once they know they 
                            can do something with the knowledge they have but he's after being experienced first 
                            by adding more to what he has. Compitence  is what drives him to hunger for more  and do more
                             research on web development which makes him to  spend endless hours in it. 
                            Being skilled is the thing for him and he's patient  enough to learn everything that is there
                             to be known. <br>
                            I believe he is one of the best web developers  that are coming up <br> as I recently saw 
                            what he is doing and indeed it's superb. His work <br> is just great and outstanding <br>

                    <p>
                        Having worked in recent projects with Mark I can say that he is efficient, <br>
                        innovative and maintains professionalism to help achieve the desired outcome. <br>
                        He understands his tools very well and uses his creativity to bring good results <br>
                        I knew him as he was just getting into the trade and for sure he has grown he has 
                        worked hard and in every thing you involve him in be sure that he is going to give 
                        you the best something worth your money
